- `validate.js`:
    Confusing terms. `emailRequired` in validation object means that the email is required. Don't use it as an error confirmation message.--done
- Proper Directories & Extra Files:
    Better to create an Auth directory that stores `server.js` and `validate.js` -----done
    Create a single file instead of two (`generateBoxs.js` and `generateRandom.js`) as both of the functions are used for similar purpose (game) and multiple functions can be exported from a single file.
- Spelling mistakes:
    Resolve spelling mistakes on the code. `Boxs`, `generateBoxs.js` etc. Use `code spell checker` extension to track spelling mistakes.
- Proper code indentations.
- Separation of imports in different sections according to their purpose along with proper comments.
    E.g: local components, global components, external plugin for ..., Css Styles, React Components.
- Remove unused State variables.
- De-select selected box if the box is already selected --done
- Upon "Play Again", only remove computer generated numbers and keep player selected number as it is.
- Reuse `validation` variable instead of calling `loginValidate` multiple times.
